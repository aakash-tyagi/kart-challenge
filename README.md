# Shopping Cart

Build a mini e-commerce shopping portal featuring product listing and a functional shopping cart.\
Prioritize correctness in functionality while getting it to look as close to the design as possible.

For this task you will need to integrate to our demo e-commerce API for listing products and submitting orders.

**Minimum requirements**

- Display products with image
- Add items to the cart and remove item
- Show order total correctly
- Increase or decrease item count in the cart
- Show order confirkmation after placing the order
- Interactive hover and focus states for elements
- Integrates with demo REST API for product listing and placing orders

**Bonus Goals**

- Allow users to enter a discount code (above confirm order button)
- Discount code `HAPPYHOURS` applies 18% discount to the order total
- Discount code `BUYGETONE` gives the lowest priced item for free
- Responsive design based on device's screen size

## Design

You can find a [Figma](https://figma.com) design file `design.fig` that you can use.
You might have to use your best judgement for some mobile layout designs and spacing.

### Style Guide

The designs were created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px

> ğŸ’¡ These are just the design sizes. Ensure content is responsive and meets WCAG requirements by testing the full range of screen sizes from 320px to large screens.

**Typography**

- Font size (product names): 16px

### Font

- Family: [Red Hat Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Text)
- Weights: 400, 600, 700

## Getting Started

Feel free to use any tool or workflow ou are comformtable with.\
Here is an example workflow (you can use it as a reference or use your own workflow)

1. Create a new public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) (alternatively you can use GitLab, BitBucket or Git server of your choice).
   If you are creating your repository on GitHub, you can chose to use this repository as a starting template. (Click on Use template button at the top)
2. Look through the deisngs to plan your project. This will help you design UI libraries or tools.
3. Create a [Vite](https://vite.dev) app to bootstrap a modern front-end project (alternatively use the framework of your choice).
4. Structure your HTML and preview before theming and adding interactive functionality.
5. Test and Iterate to build more features
6. Deploy your app anywhere securely. You may use AWS, Vercel, Deno Deploy, Surge, CloudFlare Pages or some other web app deployment services.
7. Additionally configure your repository to automatically publish your app on new commit push (CI).
